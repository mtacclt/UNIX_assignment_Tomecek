# UNIX_assignment_Tomecek
Repository for the UNIX assignment of Accolite University.

This repository hosts both the scripts I have made for the UNIX assignment. They are named part1.sh and part2.sh respectively. Aside these scripts there are my outputs from said scripts, those being the assignment folder, and the part2.csv file.

I will admit that my main issues stemmed from understanding the UNIX syntax and the way that it worked. I do not believe there are bugs in this version, and have done my best to check. The code could use additional optimization, but due to the time limitations and my currently limited understanding of UNIX, it is being submitted in this form. Additional optimizations would include additional usage of functions and cleanup of test echo commands and refactoring of variables.
